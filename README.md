## Roman Calculator
#### There are some rules to a Roman number:
Roman number|Means
---|:---:
I|One
V|Five
X|Ten
L|Fifty
C|Hundred
D|Five hundred
M|A thousand
* Numerals can be concatenated to form a larger numeral (“XX” + “II” = “XXII”)
* If a lesser numeral is put before a bigger it means subtraction of the lesser from the bigger (“IV” means four, “CM” means nine hundred)
* If the numeral is I, X or C you can't have more than three (“II” + “II” = “IV”)
* If the numeral is V, L or D you can't have more than one (“D” + “D” = “M”)
### Requirement: 
I want to add Roman numbers because doing it manually is too tedious. Given the Roman numerals, give two numbers(both <= a thousand) and add them. As we are in Rome there is no such thing as decimals or int, we need to do this with the strings. An example would be “XIV” + “LX” = “LXXIV”.
