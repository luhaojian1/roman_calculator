Roman Calculator
There are some rules to a Roman number:
Roman number	Means
I	One
V	Five
X	Ten
L	Fifty
C	Hundred
D	Five hundred
M	A thousand

•	Numerals can be concatenated to form a larger numeral (“XX” + “II” = “XXII”)
•	If a lesser numeral is put before a bigger it means subtraction of the lesser from the bigger (“IV” means four, “CM” means nine hundred)
•	If the numeral is I, X or C you can’t have more than three (“II” + “II” = “IV”)
•	If the numeral is V, L or D you can’t have more than one (“D” + “D” = “M”)


Requirement:
I want to add Roman numbers because doing it manually is too tedious. Given the Roman numerals, give two numbers(both <= a thousand) and add them.
As we are in Rome there is no such thing as decimals or int, we need to do this with the strings. An example would be “XIV” + “LX” = “LXXIV”.
